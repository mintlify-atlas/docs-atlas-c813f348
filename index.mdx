---

## What is Browser Use?

Browser Use is a powerful Python library that enables AI agents to autonomously interact with web browsers. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with browser automation, Browser Use allows you to describe tasks in natural language and have them executed automatically.

<Card title="Example Task" icon="robot">
  "Go to HackerNews, find the top 5 Show HN posts, and extract their titles, URLs, and comment counts"
</Card>

Instead of writing complex Selenium or Playwright scripts, you simply tell Browser Use what you want to accomplish, and it figures out how to do it.

## Key Features

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Provide a Task">
    Describe what you want to accomplish in natural language:
    ```python
    task = "Find the top 3 posts on HackerNews Show HN"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agent Analyzes the Page">
    The agent loads the webpage, analyzes the DOM structure, and identifies interactive elements using computer vision
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="LLM Decides Actions">
    The language model determines what actions to take: clicking, typing, scrolling, extracting data, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Actions Are Executed">
    Browser Use executes the actions through CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) and evaluates the results
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Process Repeats">
    The agent continues this loop until the task is complete or encounters an error
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Simple Example

Here's a complete working example:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, ChatBrowserUse
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Search Google for 'Python automation' and tell me the top 3 results",
        llm=ChatBrowserUse(),
    )
    history = await agent.run()
    print(history.final_result())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

<Note>
  The agent automatically handles browser setup, navigation, searching, and extracting results - all from a single task description!
</Note>

## Common Use Cases

### Data Extraction & Web Scraping
Extract structured data from websites without writing CSS selectors or XPath expressions:

```python
task = """
Go to https://quotes.toscrape.com/ and extract the first 5 quotes
with their authors and tags in a structured format
"""
```

### Form Automation
Fill out and submit forms automatically:

```python
task = """
Go to the contact form and fill it with:
- Name: John Doe
- Email: john@example.com
- Message: This is an automated test
Then submit the form
"""
```

### Authenticated Workflows
Handle logins and authenticated sessions:

```python
task = """
1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Navigate to the reports section
3. Download the latest monthly report
"""
```

### Research & Monitoring
Gather information from multiple sources:

```python
task = """
Find the latest news about browser automation tools,
compare their GitHub stars, and summarize the top 3
"""
```

## Architecture Overview

Browser Use consists of three main components:

1. **Agent** - The orchestrator that manages task execution and decision-making
2. **Browser** - The automation layer that controls Chromium via CDP
3. **Tools** - Built-in and custom actions the agent can perform

```python
from browser_use import Agent, Browser, Tools

# Configure browser
browser = Browser(
    headless=False,
    window_size={'width': 1280, 'height': 720}
)

# Add custom tools
tools = Tools()

@tools.action('Get current timestamp')
def get_timestamp() -> str:
    from datetime import datetime
    return datetime.now().isoformat()

# Create agent with custom configuration
agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=ChatBrowserUse(),
    browser=browser,
    tools=tools
)
```
