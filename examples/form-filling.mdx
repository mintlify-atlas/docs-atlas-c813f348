Browser Use can automatically fill out and submit web forms, making it perfect for automating repetitive data entry tasks.

## Basic Form Filling

This example demonstrates how to fill out a contact form with specific information:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, ChatBrowserUse
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

async def main():
    # Initialize the model
    llm = ChatBrowserUse(model='bu-2-0')
    
    # Define a form filling task
    task = """
    Go to https://httpbin.org/forms/post and fill out the contact form with:
    - Customer name: John Doe
    - Telephone: 555-123-4567
    - Email: john.doe@example.com
    - Size: Medium
    - Topping: cheese
    - Delivery time: now
    - Comments: This is a test form submission
    
    Then submit the form and tell me what response you get.
    """
    
    # Create and run the agent
    agent = Agent(task=task, llm=llm)
    await agent.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Form">
    The agent navigates to the target URL containing the form
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identify Form Fields">
    Browser Use automatically identifies interactive form elements on the page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill Fields">
    The agent fills each field with the specified data in the correct order
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit Form">
    Once all fields are filled, the agent submits the form and returns the result
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multi-Field Forms

For complex forms with multiple sections, you can provide detailed instructions:

```python
task = """
Fill out the registration form with:

Personal Information:
- First Name: Jane
- Last Name: Smith
- Email: jane.smith@example.com
- Phone: (555) 123-4567

Address:
- Street: 123 Main St
- City: San Francisco
- State: CA
- ZIP: 94102

Preferences:
- Newsletter: Yes
- Contact method: Email

Then click the Submit button and confirm the registration.
"""

agent = Agent(task=task, llm=ChatBrowserUse())
await agent.run()
```

## Handling Different Input Types

Browser Use can handle various form input types:

### Text Inputs
```python
task = "Fill the username field with 'john_doe' and password with 'SecurePass123'"
```

### Dropdowns
```python
task = "Select 'United States' from the country dropdown and 'California' from the state dropdown"
```

### Radio Buttons
```python
task = "Select 'Male' for gender and 'Yes' for newsletter subscription"
```

### Checkboxes
```python
task = "Check the boxes for 'Terms of Service' and 'Privacy Policy'"
```

### File Uploads
```python
task = "Upload the file 'resume.pdf' to the file upload field"
```

## Error Handling

Browser Use automatically handles common form issues:

<CodeGroup>
```python Retry on Failure
agent = Agent(
    task="Fill out the form...",
    llm=ChatBrowserUse(),
    max_failures=3  # Retry up to 3 times if errors occur
)
```

```python Wait for Elements
task = """
Fill out the form at example.com:
1. Wait 2 seconds for the page to fully load
2. Fill in the username and password
3. If the submit button is not clickable, wait another 2 seconds
4. Click submit
"""
```
</CodeGroup>

## Form Validation

The agent can verify that forms were filled correctly:

```python
task = """
Fill out the contact form with my information:
- Name: John Doe
- Email: john@example.com

After filling, verify that:
1. All required fields are filled (look for red asterisks)
2. Email format is valid (no error messages)
3. Submit the form only if validation passes
"""
```

## Tips for Form Filling

<Warning>
**Important**: Be specific about field names and values to ensure accurate form filling.
</Warning>

<Note>
- Use exact field labels as they appear on the page
- For dropdowns, specify the exact option text
- Allow time for page loads and dynamic content
- Test with the form's actual validation rules
</Note>
