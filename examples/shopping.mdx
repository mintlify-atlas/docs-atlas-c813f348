    2. Search for "wireless headphones"
    3. Find products under $50
    4. Add the highest rated option to cart
    5. Tell me what you added
    """
    
    agent = Agent(task=task, llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4.1-mini'))
    await agent.run()

    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Shopping Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Authentication Profiles">
    Save login sessions with cloud profiles to avoid re-authenticating
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Handle Dynamic Pricing">
    Some prices update dynamically - extract data multiple times if needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Availability">
    Always verify stock status before attempting to purchase
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Without Payment">
    Stop automation at the payment review page for safety
