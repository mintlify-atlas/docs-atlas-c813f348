## Research Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Clear Objectives">
    Specify exactly what information you need and from which sources
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Structure Your Output">
    Use Pydantic models to ensure consistent data format across sources
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Information">
    Cross-reference facts from multiple sources for accuracy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Your Progress">
    Use `save_conversation_path` to preserve research history
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Performance Tip**: For extensive research, increase `max_steps` to allow thorough investigation across multiple sites.
</Note>

<Warning>
Always respect website terms of service and robots.txt when conducting research at scale.
</Warning>

## Advanced Research Patterns

### Iterative Deep Dive
```python
task = """
Start with broad topic "renewable energy", then:
1. Identify the 3 most promising subtopics
2. For each subtopic, find top 3 authoritative sources
3. From those sources, extract key statistics and trends
4. Synthesize findings into a structured report
"""
```

### Comparative Analysis
```python
task = """
Compare cloud providers (AWS vs Azure vs GCP):
1. Visit pricing pages for each
2. Compare equivalent services (compute, storage, database)
3. Check documentation quality
4. Review customer case studies
5. Create side-by-side comparison table
